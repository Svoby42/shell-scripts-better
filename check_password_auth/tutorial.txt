Best works with masscan!
https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan

For example, scan the 95.85.0.0/16 range for SSH, HTTP and HTTPS and save
the output to a file in your Docs folder

sudo masscan 95.85.0.0/16 -p22,80,443 -oX /home/$USER/Documents/output.txt

Then you have to get IPs from the file by using gawk. For example, to get only
SSH use this command:

cat output.txt | grep 'portid="22"' | gawk -v FS=\" '{print $4}' > pureIPs.txt

The output was redirected to the pureIPs.txt file

Them run the shell script with the file as an argument

./password-auth-ssh.sh pureIPS.txt

Done!
